<h3>COS 226 Programming Assignment</h3>
<h2>Rogue</h2>

<p>

Design and implement an  effective strategy to seek out and intercept a
moving adversary. Design and implement an effective counter-strategy
to avoid being intercepted by such an adversary.


</p><p>
</p><p><b>Historical perspective.</b>
In the late 1970s, Ken Arnold designed a C library (later to be named curses) that enabled
the user to put a character at a specific location on the screen, enabling a crude
form of interactive graphics.
While experimenting with this new library, Michael Toy and Glen Wichman, designed a
graphical adventure game coined
<a href="http://www.hut.fi/%7Eeye/roguelike/rogue.html">Rogue</a>.
The purpose of Rogue is "to descend into the Dungeons of Doom, defeat monsters,
find treasure, and return to the surface with the amulet of Yendor using
its levitation capabilities."
<!-- One of the
original features of Rogue was its random generation of dungeon terrain,
so that each time you play the game, it is different. -->
This revolutionary game became the undisputed most popular game on college
campuses after it was included in BSD Unix 4.2 in 1980. It would later
spawn the role-playing game (RPG) genre, including its direct descendant NetHack.

</p><p>
In 1984, a group of grad students at CMU developed a computer program
named <a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/%7Eappel/papers/rogomatic.html">Rog-o-matic</a>
to automatically play the game of Rogue. At one time, the Rog-o-matic
player was the highest rated Rogue player at CMU.
A crucial component of the Rog-o-matic algorithm was to avoid contact with
the monster for as long as possible, so that the your health could
regenerate before confronting the monster in a battle to the death.
This involves an interesting graph search problem, and is the inspiration
for this programming assignment.

</p><p><strong>Rules of the game.</strong>
The game of Rogue is played on an N-by-N grid that represents the dungeon.
The rogue (typically a human player)
is represented with the character <tt>@</tt>.
The monster is represented by an uppercase letter. (In the real game of Rogue, there
are 26 different monsters named <tt>A</tt> through
<tt>Z</tt>, each with different capabilities.)
The monster and rogue take turns making moves, with the monster going first.
If the monster intercepts the rogue (occupies the same site), then 
the monster burns/freezes/bludgeons the rogue to death, and the game ends.
In each turn, a player either remains stationary or moves to an adjacent site.
There are three types of sites: room, corridor, and wall, and they are
represented by
<tt>'.'</tt>, <tt>'+'</tt>,  and <tt>' '</tt>, respectively.
If the player is in a room site, then they can
move to an adjacent room site in one of the 8 compass directions
(N, E, S, W, NW, NE, SW, SE) or a corridor site in one of the 4 
directions (N, E, S, W). If the player is in a corridor site, then they can move
to an adjacent room or corridor site in one of the 4 directions
(N, E, S, W). The walls are impenetrable.

In the first dungeon above, the rogue can avoid the <em>Ice</em> Monster <tt>I</tt>
indefinitely by moving N and running around the corridor.
In the second dungeon, the <em>Aquator</em> Monster <tt>A</tt> can use the
diagonal moves to trap the rogue in a corner.


<p><strong>Monster's strategy.</strong>
The monster is tenacious and its sole mission is to chase and intercept the rogue.
A natural strategy for the monster is to always take one step toward the rogue.
In terms of the underlying graph, this means that the monster should compute
a shortest path between itself and the rogue, and take one step
along such a path. This strategy is not necessarily optimal, since there
may be ties, and taking a step along one
shortest path may be better than taking a step along another shortest path.
For example, in the first dungeon below the <em>Bat</em> Monster's only optimal strategy
is to take a step in the NE direction. Moving N or E would enable
the rogue to make a mad dash for the opposite corridor entrance.
In the second dungeon, the <em>Centaur</em> Monster can guarantee to intercept the rogue
by moving E.

<p>
Your first task is to implement an effective strategy for the monster.

</p><p><strong>Rogue's strategy.</strong>
The rogue's goal is to avoid the monster for as long as possible.
A naive strategy is to move to an adjacent site that is as far as possible
from the monster's current location.
It is easy to see that this strategy may lead to a quick
and unnecessary death, as in the second dungeon below where the rogue can
avoid the <em>Jabberwock</em> Monster by moving SE.
Another potentially deadly strategy would be to go to the nearest corridor.
To avoid the <em>Flytrap</em> Monster, the rogue must move towards a
northern hallway.

A more effective strategy is to identify a sequence of adjacent corridor and
room sites which the rogue can run around in circles forever, thereby
avoiding the monster indefinitely. This involves identifying
and following certain cycles in the underlying graph.
Of course, such cycles may not always exist, in which case your goal is
to survive for as long as possible.


</p><p>
<strong>Input format.</strong>
&nbsp;
The input dungeon consists of an integer N, followed by N rows
of 2N characters each.
</p><blockquote><pre>10

A <em>room</em> is a contiguous rectangular block of room sites.
Because of dungeon construction safety requirements, rooms may not
connect directly with each other. That is,
any path from one room to another will use at least one 
corridor site.
There will be exactly one monster and one rogue, and each will start
in some room site. Here are a number of 
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs226/rogue">sample dungeons</a>
for testing.


<p><strong>The rogue game engine.</strong>
&nbsp;
So that you can concentrate on the strategy part of the program, we provide
some of the infrastructure. Your task is to write a program <tt>Monster.java</tt>
that has the following interface.

</p><blockquote><pre>public Monster(Game g)    // create a new monster who is playing a game g
public Site move()        // return the adjacent site to which you are moving
</pre></blockquote>

and an analogous program <tt>Rogue.java</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>public Rogue(Game g)      // create a new rogue who is playing a game g
public Site move()        // return the adjacent site to which you are moving
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

Program <tt>Game.java</tt> reads in the 
dungeon from standard input and does the game playing and refereeing.
It has three primary interface functions that will be needed by
<tt>Rogue.java</tt> and <tt>Monster.java</tt>.


</p><blockquote><pre>public Site getMonsterSite()                // return the site occupied by the monster
public Site getRogueSite()                  // return the site occupied by the rogue
public Dungeon getDungeon()                 // return the dungeon
</pre></blockquote>

Program <tt>Dungeon.java</tt> represents an N-by-N dungeon.

<blockquote><pre>public boolean isLegalMove(Site v, Site w)  // is moving from site v to w legal?
public boolean isCorridor(Site v)           // is site v a corridor site?
public boolean isRoom(Site v)               // is site v a room site?
public int size()                           // return N = dimension of dungeon
</pre></blockquote>

Program <tt>Site.java</tt> is a tiny data type that represents a
location site in the N-by-N dungeon.

<blockquote><pre>public Site(int i, int j)                   // instantiate a new Site for location (i, j)
public int i()                              // get i coordinate
public int j()                              // get j coordinate
public int manhattan(Site w)                // return Manhattan distance from invoking site to w
public boolean equals(Site w)               // is invoking site equal to w?
</pre></blockquote>

<p><strong>Deliverables.</strong>
&nbsp;
Submit your version of <tt>Monster.java</tt> and <tt>Rogue.java</tt>, along with any
accompanying code and <tt>readme.txt</tt>.
Justify your strategies, explaining their strengths and weaknesses.

</p><p><strong>Extra credit.</strong>
&nbsp;
Submit some interesting dungeons that are useful for debugging,
testing, and developing strategies. Describe each dungeon and
why it is useful or interesting. Creativity will also be a factor.


</p><p><strong>Challenges for the bored.</strong>
&nbsp; There are limitless additional possibilities for creativity here.
We don't really expect that you can do these now, but try them sometime
for a challenge. Allow two monsters that can coordinate their attack.
Make it work on arbitrary graphs. In the real game, you don't
even know the whole graph until you start walking through it,
so account for this. In the real game, the rogue collects
treasure, potions, and powerful weapons while traveling through
the dungeon. Modify your strategy to maximize the amount of material
collected, while still avoiding the monster.
