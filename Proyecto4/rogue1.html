</td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><b>What's the Manhattan distance?</b>
If you have two sites located a coordinates (i1, j1) and (i2, j2),
then the Manhattan distance between i and j is |i1 - i2| + |j1 - j2|.
Is is the length you have to travel, assuming you can only move horizontally
and vertically, as in Manhattan city blocks.

</p><p>
<b>How large will the dungeons be?</b>
They will likely be very small, like the sample input files.
Of course, this does not give you license to use grossly inefficient algorithms,
Ideally, a linear amount of work <em>per move</em>, but quadratic is not too bad.
Here, linear means proportional to N<sup>2</sup> since the input is of size N<sup>2</sup>.
Do not worry much about the constants of proportionality, especially if
if it makes your program easier to understand.

</p><p>
<b>I want another interface method for <tt>Game.java</tt>. Am I allowed to add one?</b>
No, we will use our versions of <tt>Game.java</tt>, <tt>Dungeon.java</tt>, and
<tt>Site.java</tt>, so you must stick to our specs.
If you lobby convincingly to the instructor, we might add one and make it available
to the whole class.

</p><p>
<b>Which should I implement first, the monster or the hero?</b>
We recommend the monster strategy since it is probably easier to devise and implement.
It is also a good starting point for the hero strategy.

</p><p><b>Must my resulting strategies be optimal?</b>
That's not a requirement. We believe our implementations are optimal
on the dungeons supplied, but there are dungeons on which 
they are sub-optimal.
We will award extra credit if you supply such a dungeon.

</p><p>
<b>Can I run my ideas by the staff members?</b>
Of course. We will do our best to poke holes
in your strategies if we can.

<!--
<p><b>Can I use inheritance to reuse code?</b>
Sure, it's reasonable to have a <tt>Player</tt> superclass,
and <tt>Rogue</tt> and <tt>Monster</tt> subclasses. Note that
constructors are not inherited in Java.
-->

</p><p><b>Do I need to use an explicit Graph?</b>
No, but if you do, you can reuse the graph code from lecture or the Sedgewick
book. Otherwise, you will have to re-create BFS and DFS (which is good
programming experience).

</p><p><b>Can I cheat?</b>
The game engine <tt>Game.java</tt> is not industrial strength, and there may
be some opportunities to cheat the system. Your monster and hero implementations
must play by the rules. However, to encourage security awareness, we will award
some extra credit if you indicate any weaknesses you can exploit and what
changes you would need to make to prevent such hacking.

<strong>Test dungeons.</strong>
We have crafted a number of sample dungeons, named
<tt>dungeon[A-Z].txt</tt>, each with a different starting configuration.
Each file contains a brief description of what the dungeon is testing.
You will certainly want to use some of these as test cases, and we will
draw some of our grading test cases from these inputs.

</p><p><b>Grading.</b>
Your monster and hero strategies will face off against our
super-secret implementations in a fight to the death.

<p></p><li> Download the directory
<a href="ftp://ftp.cs.princeton.edu/pub/cs226/rogue">rogue</a>.
This directory is mirrored on arizona at
<tt>/u/cos226/pub/rogue</tt>. It contains a number of 
sample dungeons and the game engine (<tt>Game.java</tt>,
<tt>Site.java</tt>, <tt>Dungeon.java</tt>, and <tt>In.java</tt>).

<p></p></li><li> Try out your strategies with the interactive versions
of the game <tt>rogue1.jar</tt> and <tt>rogue2.jar</tt>. In
<tt>rogue1.jar</tt>, you are the monster and your goal is to
intercept the computer rogue; in <tt>rogue2.jar</tt>, you are
the rogue and your goal is to evade the monster.  To run the
executable jar files, use the following commands.
<blockquote><pre>% java -jar rogue1.jar &lt; dungeon.txt
% java -jar rogue2.jar &lt; dungeon.txt
</pre></blockquote>



<p></p></li><li> Programs <tt>Monster.java</tt> and <tt>Rogue.java</tt>
provide a template for the players. At each step the player
chooses a random move among all legal moves. 
Run the game using the default monster and rogue implementations.
<blockquote><pre>java Game &lt; dungeon.txt | more
</pre></blockquote>

<p></p></li><li>

<p></p></li><li>
To implement the monster's strategy, you will almost certainly
want to use BFS. Start with the provided file <tt>Monster.java</tt>,
but rewrite the method <tt>move</tt> to implement your strategy.
You may wish to modify the constructor so that it builds a graph
of the underlying dungeon. If you do so, be sure to thoroughly test
that it's building the graph correctly.

<p></p></li><li>
To implement the rogue's strategy, you may want to use both BFS
and DFS. You can learn about using DFS to find the bridges in a graph 
in Sedgewick, Chapter 18.6.

<b>Is there a Java version of the game?</b>
Certainly, here is

<b>Where can I learn more about Rogue?</b>
Here is a description of the

monsters</a> and information on weopons, potions, and treasure.
